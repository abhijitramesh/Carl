# Introduction

## What is object oriented programming

Object oriented programing is used for expressing real-world objects in programming concepts like objects and classes and also to take advantage of features like 

* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction 
* Encapsulation

## Difference between classes and objects

|    Classes                                                        |            Objects                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|                                    
| A Class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created | An Object is an instance of a class             |
| A Class is declared once                                          | An Object can be created anynumber of times     |
| Class does not allocate memory when it is created                 | An Object takes up memory when they are created |


## What is Inheritance ?

Inheritance is the property by which a class or an object can acquires all the properties of the Parent class or object.

## What is Polymorphism ?

Polymorphism means performing a task in different ways. There are two types of Polymorphism in java 

1. Compile-time Polymorphism
1. Run-time Polymorphism

## What is an Abstraction ?

Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation of a class from a user and only shows the required data.

## What is Encapsulation ?

The process of wrapping up of the code into a single unit is called Encapsulation.

# Naming Conventions in Java

## Classes

While naming Classes it is always recomeneded to start with capital letter.
Nouns are given the names for Classes and it should be an apropriate word rather than acronyms.

## Interface

While naming Interfaces it should always start with capital letter.
It should always be an adjective and should be an aproprate word rather than an acronym.

## Methods

While naming Methods it should always start with small letter.
It should alwaus be a verb.If it contains more than one world the starting of the second word could be Capitalized.
example: actionPerformed()

## Variables

Variable names should always start with small letters. There should not be any special characters while naming a variable.
Naming a variable as x,y,z is not recommended it is better to use something like name, address etc....

## Packages

Pacakage names should be lowercase words and each word should be seperated by a dot(.).

## Constants

Constants should be named in all caps, example PI. If there are more than one word it is recommended to use and _ to seperate them example THE_VALUE_OF_PI.
