# Object

An Object is something that can be compared to a real-world entity. Let's consider Carl now has a name, Carl has a color brown, Carl's behaviour is being Curious.

Just like Carl (A real world Object) Java Objects (Software Object) also have identity,state and behaviour.

The Object is an instance of the Class.
